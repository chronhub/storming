When working with CQRS, DDD, and event sourcing, it's often helpful to use non-technical terms that align with the conceptual nature of these patterns. Here are some suggestions for naming around the concepts of "Chronicler" (event store), "Story" (CQRS), and "Projection":

### Chronicler (Event Store)
- **Archive**: Suggests a place where events are stored and preserved for future reference.
- **Ledger**: Implies a detailed record of transactions or events, similar to an accounting ledger.
- **Chronicle**: Emphasizes the recording of events in a chronological order, capturing the history.
- **Journal**: Conveys the idea of a day-by-day recording of significant events, similar to a personal or official journal.
- **Record**: A straightforward term that implies the storage of facts or events.
- **Repository**: A place where data or artifacts are stored, often used in a non-technical context.
- **Annals**: Refers to a historical record of events, often in a chronological order.

### Story (CQRS)
- **Narrative**: Suggests the unfolding of actions or events over time, aligning with the idea of a "command" or "query" telling part of a story.
- **Chapter**: Implies a section or portion of a larger narrative, which can relate to a command or query within the broader application context.
- **Tale**: Represents an individual account or series of events, which can correspond to a specific action or result in the system.
- **Dispatch**: Conveys the idea of sending or delivering a message, aligning with the nature of commands or queries.
- **Request**: A simple, intuitive term that refers to asking for information or action, fitting well with CQRS operations.
- **Inquiry**: Reflects the idea of querying or seeking information, which aligns with the "query" aspect of CQRS.
- **Report**: Suggests the outcome or feedback from an action, aligning with what a query would return.
- **Message**: A neutral term that can be used for both commands and queries, emphasizing communication.

### Projection (Read Models)
- **View**: Emphasizes how data is presented or seen, aligning with the idea of projections creating a readable model.
- **Perspective**: Suggests a particular angle or way of seeing data, which aligns with the concept of projections offering a specific view of the events.
- **Snapshot**: Implies a captured state at a specific point in time, similar to how projections represent the current state of events.
- **Summary**: Reflects the idea of condensing information into a simplified form, which projections often do.
- **Insight**: Conveys the idea of gaining understanding or knowledge from the data, which is the purpose of projections.
- **Profile**: Suggests a comprehensive view or summary of data, similar to how a projection offers a detailed look at a specific aspect of the system.
- **Outlook**: Emphasizes a forward-looking view, which can relate to how projections often prepare data for upcoming queries.
- **Reflection**: Implies mirroring or representing the state of events, aligning with the projection's role in event sourcing.

### Example Integration

- **Archive** (for Chronicler): Store events in the "Archive" to preserve the history of all actions in the system.
- **Narrative** (for Story): Use "Narratives" to define the flow of actions and their outcomes within the system.
- **Perspective** (for Projection): Create "Perspectives" to provide tailored views of the stored events for different needs.

These non-technical terms help to humanize the concepts, making them more accessible and intuitive to a broader audience, while still preserving the underlying principles of CQRS, DDD, and event sourcing.
