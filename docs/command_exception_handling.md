## Command Execution and Exception Handling Strategy

- **Failure Handling:**
    - **Immediate Failure:** Commands fail on the first execution attempt.
    - **Nuanced Approach:** Consider categorizing exceptions for differentiated handling.

- **Exception Sources:**
    - **Domain Logic:** Most exceptions from business rule violations.
    - **Infrastructure:** Database issues, external service failures, etc.
    - **Concurrency:** Race conditions, duplicate executions.

- **Retry Considerations:**
    - **Avoid automatic retries for domain logic exceptions.**
    - **Consider retries for transient infrastructure issues.**
    - **Implement idempotency for safely retryable commands.**

- **Concurrency Handling:**
    - **Pay special attention to race conditions and duplicates.**
    - **Consider using version-based conflict resolution strategies.**

- **Event Sourcing Implications:**
    - **Ensure event stream integrity and correct ordering.**
    - **Consider compensating events for certain failure scenarios.**
    - **Implement event publishing as part of the command handling process.**

- **Consistency and Boundaries:**
    - **Respect aggregate boundaries for consistency guarantees.**
    - **Consider eventual consistency for cross-aggregate operations.**

- **Error Recovery Strategies:**
    - **Implement compensating actions for certain types of failures.**
    - **Provide mechanisms for manual intervention and recovery.**

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
    - **Log all command failures with detailed context.**
    - **Implement comprehensive monitoring for command execution patterns.**

- **Performance Considerations:**
    - **Balance between immediate failure and retry attempts.**
    - **Consider the impact of exception handling on system performance.**

- **Developer Responsibilities:**
    - **Analyze and address recurring exceptions.**
    - **Regularly review and update exception handling strategies.**
    - **Ensure proper error reporting and alerting mechanisms are in place.**

**Note:** The current implementation fails immediately and throws exceptions. Consider refining this approach based on specific system requirements and the nature of commands being processed.
