### **1. Outbox Pattern**

- **Purpose:** To ensure reliable and consistent event publishing from your event store (PostgreSQL) to your message broker (RabbitMQ).

- **Process:**
    1. **Event Storage:** When a domain event occurs, it's first stored in the event store (PostgreSQL).
    2. **Outbox Entry:** The same event is also stored in a dedicated `outbox` table within PostgreSQL, but marked as "unprocessed."
    3. **Publish Command:** A Laravel command (or similar) periodically reads unprocessed events from the outbox table.
    4. **Publishing:** Each event is published to RabbitMQ.
    5. **Mark Processed:** Once successfully published, the event is marked as "processed" in the outbox table.

### **2. Message Broker (RabbitMQ)**

- **Purpose:** To decouple event producers from consumers, allowing events to be processed asynchronously.

- **Process:**
    1. **Event Publishing:** Events from the outbox table are sent to RabbitMQ, which holds them temporarily.
    2. **Message Routing:** RabbitMQ routes events to the appropriate queues based on event types or routing keys.
    3. **Consumer Acknowledgment:** Consumers (projections or other services) listen to RabbitMQ queues and process events as they arrive.

### **3. Live Projections (MySQL)**

- **Purpose:** To maintain up-to-date read models that represent the current state of the system, optimized for queries.

- **Process:**
    1. **Event Consumption:** A Laravel listener or service consumes events from RabbitMQ.
    2. **Projection Update:** Based on the event type and payload, the listener updates the corresponding projections in the MySQL database. This could involve inserting, updating, or deleting records.
    3. **Live Read Model:** The projections in MySQL serve as the live read models that your application queries.

### **4. Rebuilding Projections**

- **Purpose:** To recreate the read models if they become inconsistent, corrupted, or if there are changes in the projection logic.

- **Process:**
    1. **Event Replay:** Events are read sequentially from the event store (PostgreSQL).
    2. **Reapply Events:** The events are re-applied to the projection tables, rebuilding the current state.
    3. **Idempotency:** Ensure that reapplying the same event doesn't result in inconsistent data, making the projection logic idempotent.

### **Summary**

- **Reliability:** The outbox pattern ensures that events are reliably published to RabbitMQ, even if there are failures or interruptions.
- **Scalability:** RabbitMQ decouples the event production from consumption, allowing your system to scale more easily.
- **Consistency:** Projections in MySQL are updated in near real-time as events are processed, ensuring that your application has fast access to the current state.
- **Rebuild Capability:** If projections are lost or need to be updated, they can be rebuilt by replaying events from the event store.
