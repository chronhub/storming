#Where to start

CQRS, DDD, and Event Sourcing can be complex, so starting with a simple domain is crucial. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Simple To-Do List Application
   * Domain: Task management
   * Aggregates: TodoList, Task
   * Events: TaskCreated, TaskCompleted, TaskDeleted, TaskDescriptionUpdated, TaskDueDateUpdated
   * Benefits: Simple domain with clear events, easy to understand aggregate structure, and a good starting point for learning the patterns.

2. Basic Banking Account
   * Domain: Banking
   * Aggregates: Account
   * Events: AccountOpened, DepositMade, WithdrawalMade, TransferMade
   * Benefits: Introduces concepts like money transfers and balances, which can be extended to more complex scenarios.

3. Inventory Management
   * Domain: Product Management
   * Aggregates: Product
   * Events: ProductCreated, ProductUpdated, ProductDeleted, InventoryIncreased, InventoryDecreased
   * Benefits: Introduces concepts of quantity management and potential for more complex scenarios like order processing.
   
Key Considerations When Choosing a Domain

  *  Simplicity: Start with a domain that has a clear and limited scope.
  *  Bounded Context: Identify a clear boundary for your domain to avoid unnecessary complexity.
  *  Event Storming: Conduct an event storming session to discover domain events and aggregates.
  *  Incremental Development: Start with a basic implementation and gradually add features.
  *  Remember: The goal is to understand the core concepts of CQRS, DDD, and Event Sourcing. Avoid over-engineering and focus on learning the fundamentals.

Additional Tips:

Start small: Begin with a basic implementation and gradually add features.
Focus on learning: The primary goal is to understand the patterns, not build a production-ready system.
Experiment: Try different approaches and learn from your mistakes.
By starting with a simple domain and gradually increasing complexity, you'll gain a solid foundation in CQRS, DDD, and Event Sourcing.
