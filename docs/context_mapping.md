**Context Mapping** is a concept from Domain-Driven Design (DDD) that helps manage the relationships and interactions between different Bounded Contexts within a system. In DDD, a **Bounded Context** represents a specific area of the domain model with its own set of rules and terminology. **Context Mapping** provides a structured way to define and manage how these contexts interact with each other.

### **What is Context Mapping?**

Context Mapping is the process of identifying and managing the boundaries between Bounded Contexts and defining how they interact. It helps in understanding the integration points and potential issues that may arise when different contexts need to collaborate.

### **Key Elements of Context Mapping**

1. **Bounded Contexts**:
    - Each Bounded Context has its own model and rules, and it interacts with other contexts in specific ways.
    - Example: `DirectDebit`, `Billing`, and `CustomerManagement` can each be Bounded Contexts with distinct responsibilities and models.

2. **Context Maps**:
    - **Context Maps** are diagrams or documents that describe the relationships and interactions between different Bounded Contexts.
    - They help visualize how data and commands flow between contexts and identify integration points.

### **Types of Relationships in Context Mapping**

1. **Shared Kernel**:
    - A Shared Kernel is a subset of the domain model that is shared between two or more Bounded Contexts.
    - Example: Both `DirectDebit` and `Billing` contexts might share a common understanding of `Customer` but manage it differently.

2. **Customer-Supplier**:
    - In this relationship, one context (the **Supplier**) provides information or services to another context (the **Customer**).
    - Example: `DirectDebit` could be a Customer of `CustomerManagement`, consuming customer data.

3. **Conformist**:
    - In a Conformist relationship, one context conforms to the model or rules of another context.
    - Example: `DirectDebit` might conform to the data model provided by `Billing`.

4. **Anticorruption Layer**:
    - An Anticorruption Layer (ACL) is used to protect one context from the influence of another, ensuring that the models do not corrupt each other.
    - Example: If `DirectDebit` interacts with a legacy system or a third-party service, an ACL can translate between the external model and the internal model.

5. **Open Host Service**:
    - This is a well-defined API provided by one context that other contexts can interact with.
    - Example: `DirectDebit` could expose an API that `Billing` uses to initiate transactions.

6. **Published Language**:
    - This is a common language or format used for communication between contexts.
    - Example: `DirectDebit` and `CustomerManagement` might use a standardized message format for communication.

### **Creating a Context Map**

1. **Identify Bounded Contexts**:
    - Define the boundaries and responsibilities of each Bounded Context in your system.

2. **Determine Relationships**:
    - Analyze how each context interacts with others and categorize these interactions (e.g., Shared Kernel, Customer-Supplier).

3. **Define Integration Points**:
    - Identify where and how contexts will integrate. This might include shared databases, APIs, or messaging systems.

4. **Map the Interactions**:
    - Create diagrams or documents to visualize the relationships and interactions between contexts. This helps in understanding data flow, dependencies, and potential issues.

5. **Address Integration Challenges**:
    - Plan for schema evolution, data consistency, and communication patterns. Implement solutions like ACLs if necessary.

### **Example of Context Mapping**

Hereâ€™s a simplified example showing how `DirectDebit`, `Billing`, and `CustomerManagement` might interact:

```text
+--------------------+       +------------------+
|   DirectDebit      |       |   Billing        |
|   (Context)        |       |   (Context)      |
|                    |       |                  |
|  - Manages         |       |  - Handles       |
|    Direct Debits   |<----->|    Invoices      |
|  - Processes       |       |  - Generates     |
|    Transactions    |       |    Bills         |
|                    |       |                  |
+--------------------+       +------------------+
         |                           ^
         |                           |
         |                           |
         v                           |
+--------------------+                |
| CustomerManagement |                |
|      (Context)     |                |
|                    |                |
|  - Manages         |<---------------+
|    Customer Data   |
|  - Provides Data   |
+--------------------+

```

### **Summary**

- **Context Mapping** helps define and manage the relationships between different Bounded Contexts in a system.
- It involves identifying how contexts interact, categorizing these interactions, and addressing integration challenges.
- By using Context Maps, you can ensure that different parts of your system communicate effectively while maintaining clear boundaries and minimizing the impact of changes across contexts.
