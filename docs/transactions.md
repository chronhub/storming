 # Transaction handling

1. Transactional:
    - Use when the command affects multiple aggregates or entities that need to be updated atomically.
    - When consistency is critical, and all operations must succeed or fail together.
    - Example: Transferring money between two bank accounts.

2. Nested Transactional:
    - Use when a command triggers sub-commands that need their own transaction scopes.
    - When you need to manage the complexity of multiple related operations with different transactional requirements.
    - Example: Processing an order that involves updating inventory, creating a shipment, and charging a customer.

3. No Transaction:
    - Use for idempotent operations that can be safely retried without side effects.
    - When eventual consistency is acceptable, and the operation doesn't require immediate atomicity.
    - For commands that don't modify the system state or only affect a single aggregate.
    - Example: Updating a user's preferences or logging an event.

To determine the appropriate approach, consider these factors:

1. Consistency requirements: How important is it for all parts of the command to succeed or fail together?

2. Aggregate boundaries: Does the command cross multiple aggregate boundaries? If so, you might need a transaction.

3. Performance impact: Transactions can impact performance, especially in distributed systems. Consider if the consistency benefit outweighs the performance cost.

4. Idempotency: Can the command be safely retried without causing unintended side effects?

5. Business requirements: Some business processes may dictate specific transactional needs.

6. Complexity: Nested transactions add complexity. Only use them when simpler approaches are insufficient.

7. Event publishing: Consider how events are published in relation to your transactions.

8. Scalability: Non-transactional approaches often scale better in distributed systems.

Remember that in event sourcing, you're typically working with a single aggregate per transaction. If you need to update multiple aggregates, consider using domain events and eventual consistency where possible, rather than relying on distributed transactions.

# Concepts

1. Single Aggregate per Transaction:
   In event sourcing and DDD, an aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. The general recommendation is to keep transactions limited to a single aggregate. This is because:

    - It maintains clear boundaries and encapsulation.
    - It reduces contention and improves concurrency.
    - It aligns with the principle of aggregate roots being consistency boundaries.

2. Challenges with Multiple Aggregates:
   When you need to update multiple aggregates, you might be tempted to use a distributed transaction. However, this can lead to:

    - Increased complexity
    - Potential performance issues
    - Scalability problems, especially in distributed systems

3. Using Domain Events and Eventual Consistency:
   Instead of using distributed transactions, a better approach is often to use domain events and embrace eventual consistency:

    - Domain Events: These are events that represent something significant that happened in your domain. They can be published when an aggregate is updated.

    - Eventual Consistency: This means that the system will become consistent over time, rather than immediately.

Here's how this typically works:

1. A command comes in to update Aggregate A.
2. Aggregate A is updated within a single transaction.
3. As part of this update, a domain event is published.
4. This domain event is then picked up by a separate process or handler.
5. This handler then updates Aggregate B based on the event from Aggregate A.

This approach has several benefits:

- It keeps transactions simple and fast.
- It allows the system to scale more easily.
- It more closely models real-world business processes, which often don't happen instantaneously.

Example:
Consider an e-commerce system where placing an order needs to update both the Order aggregate and the Inventory aggregate.

Instead of updating both in a single transaction:
1. The Order aggregate is updated and an "OrderPlaced" event is published.
2. A separate handler listens for "OrderPlaced" events and updates the Inventory aggregate accordingly.

This way, the order placement is fast and responsive, while the inventory update happens shortly after, but not necessarily instantaneously.

There may be cases where strict consistency is required, and in those cases, you might need to consider other patterns or accept the trade-offs of distributed transactions.
